The Eagles started 8\\u20130 for the first time in franchise history, before their winning streak was snapped with a 32\\u201321 upset loss to the Washington Commanders in Week 10. They improved on their 9\\u20138 record from last year after a 40\\u201333 victory over the Green Bay Packers in Week 12. With a 48\\u201322 road win over the division rival New York Giants in Week 14, the Eagles clinched their second straight playoff berth, and their fifth in six seasons. After a 25\\u201320 road win over the Chicago Bears in Week 15, the Eagles matched their franchise-best 13\\u20131 start in the 2004 season and secured their third 13-win season win in franchise history, after 2004 and 2017. With a 22\\u201316 win over the Giants in Week 18, the Eagles won the NFC East for the first time since 2019, and clinched the NFC's #1 seed for the first time since 2017. The Eagles also reached 14 regular season wins, a franchise record. In the Divisional Round, the Eagles routed the Giants 38\\u20137 for their first postseason win since 2018. With this win, Philadelphia completed a 3-0 sweep of all three games played against New York, and advanced to the NFC Championship for the first time since 2017. The Eagles went on to win the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers 31\\u20137, advancing to Super Bowl LVII, their fourth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, to face the Kansas City Chiefs and former longtime head coach Andy Reid.

Game summaries Week 1: at Detroit Lions For the third straight year, the Eagles were on the road to kick off the season. After the Lions scored on their opening drive, the Eagles would score 21 unanswered points. The Lions would try and rally with 21 points in the second half, but the Eagles would hang on and defeat the Lions for the second straight year. With the win, the Eagles started 1\\u20130 for the ninth time since 2010 and for the second time under head coach Nick Sirianni. Week 2: vs. Minnesota Vikings This week 2 matchup was thought to see two high powered offenses go at it in a possible high scoring affair. However, only the Eagles would show off their high powered offense. The Eagles would receive the ball and march down the field finishing with a 3 yard Jalen Hurts touchdown. Kicking off the second quarter, Jalen Hurts would connect with Quez Watkins on a 53 yard touchdown to double Philadelphia's lead to 14\\u20130. The Vikings would counter that with a touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins to Irv Smith Jr. Later in the second quarter, Jalen Hurts would scramble and power his way in for a 26 yard touchdown (the longest from an Eagles QB since Donovan McNabb in 2002). The Eagles would close out the second quarter with a Jake Elliott 38 yard field goal. In the second half, the Eagles defense would step up and shut down the Vikings offense.

In 2020, the Eagles finished with a dismal 4–11–1 record, missed the playoffs, and finished in last place in the NFC East. They struggled with injuries, poor quarterback play, and had one of the worst seasons in franchise history. Head coach Doug Pederson was dismissed after the season, and it marked the end of the Carson Wentz era in Philadelphia. In contrast, the 2023 season saw the Eagles make the playoffs, although they had a late-season collapse and were eliminated in the Wild Card round. Head coach Nick Sirianni faced criticism for the team's performance, but they still managed to make the postseason, making it a less disappointing season compared to 2020.\n"
