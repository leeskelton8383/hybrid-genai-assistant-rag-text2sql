# Hybrid GenAI Assistant: RAG + Natural Language Query

This project demonstrates a modular **GenAI question-answering assistant** that uses a **language model as a dynamic router** to decide which tool to use for a given question.

The assistant can route questions to:

- **Text-to-SQL** for querying structured data (SQLite)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for narrative or historical context
- **A hybrid path** when both structured stats and narrative explanation are useful

The current implementation uses **Philadelphia Eagles NFL data (2020–2025)** as the demonstration domain, but the architecture is intentionally domain-agnostic.

At the core of the system is an **LLM-based router** that:
- Interprets the user’s natural language question
- Classifies intent and extracts entities (player, stat, year, opponent, etc.)
- Selects the appropriate tool: SQL, RAG, or both
- Composes a final answer from the tool outputs

## What This Assistant Can Do

### Text-to-SQL (Structured Queries)

- Translates natural language into SQL
- Applies schema-aware prompt constraints
- Executes queries against a local SQLite database
- Returns results as pandas DataFrames

**Example questions:**
- “How many rushing yards did Jalen Hurts have in 2022?”
- “Compare Eagles offensive production in 2023 vs 2024”

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Narrative Context)

- Retrieves relevant text chunks from Wikipedia-style documents
- Uses vector similarity search (FAISS)
- Injects retrieved context into the LLM prompt for grounded explanations

**Example questions:**
- “Why did the Eagles lose momentum mid-season in 2024?”
- “What injuries affected the Eagles offense late in the year?”

### LLM-Based Question Router

The router is powered by an LLM rather than hard-coded rules. It:

- Determines whether a question is factual, explanatory, or mixed
- Extracts key entities for downstream tools
- Decides which tool(s) to invoke
- Sends results to a composer that synthesizes the final response

This design makes the system **tool-aware**, **flexible**, and **extensible**.

## Architecture Overview

High-level flow:

- User submits a natural language question  
- An **LLM-based router** analyzes the question  
- The router selects one or more tools:  
  - Text-to-SQL for structured stats  
  - RAG for narrative context  
- Tool outputs are passed to an answer composer  
- The system returns a synthesized response combining stats and explanation

## Data Overview

### Structured Data

- Eagles player, game, and season-level statistics from nflVerse https://github.com/nflverse.
- Seasons: 2020–2025  
- Stored in SQLite and queried using Text-to-SQL

### Unstructured Data

- Wikipedia-style narrative documents  
- Chunked with overlap  
- Embedded and indexed for semantic retrieval  
- Used exclusively for RAG-based responses
